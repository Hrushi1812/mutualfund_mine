- **Test Code:** [TC007_Excel_Upload___Valid_Lumpsum_Holdings_File.py](./TC007_Excel_Upload___Valid_Lumpsum_Holdings_File.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that a valid Excel file containing lumpsum mutual fund holdings can be uploaded and parsed correctly was partially completed. Login and navigation to the portfolio upload section were successful. Form fields for Fund Name, Investment Mode, Invested Amount, and Invested Date were filled correctly. However, the critical step of uploading the valid lumpsum Excel file using the file upload action could not be completed due to interface limitations preventing file upload. Consequently, verification of successful parsing and portfolio overview update could not be confirmed. Task is marked as incomplete.

#### Test TC016
- **Test Name:** Frontend Responsive UI and Navigation
- **Test Code:** [TC016_Frontend_Responsive_UI_and_Navigation.py](./TC016_Frontend_Responsive_UI_and_Navigation.py)
- **Test Error:** The frontend UI responsiveness and navigation testing is partially complete. The landing, login, and dashboard pages were tested for desktop and tablet screen sizes with UI components adapting correctly and remaining usable. Navigation between these pages was smooth with no glitches or broken links. Mobile responsiveness was tested only on the login page, and further mobile responsiveness testing on the dashboard and other pages was not completed. Overall, the UI is responsive and navigation is smooth on tested screen sizes, but full mobile responsiveness across all pages remains to be verified.

#### Test TC018
- **Test Name:** Data Persistence and Retrieval from MongoDB
- **Test Code:** [TC018_Data_Persistence_and_Retrieval_from_MongoDB.py](./TC018_Data_Persistence_and_Retrieval_from_MongoDB.py)
- **Test Error:** User registration verified by duplicate username error indicating user data exists in MongoDB. User logged in successfully with provided credentials. Portfolio upload form was filled with portfolio/fund name, nickname, investment mode, invested amount, and invested date. However, the mandatory holdings Excel file was not uploaded, causing a validation error and preventing portfolio data persistence verification. Therefore, user data verification is complete, but portfolio and fund data verification is incomplete due to missing file upload. Task is partially complete.
